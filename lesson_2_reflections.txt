>What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repositiory you are allowing git to add metadata that will be important for it to function properly

>How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area will hold specific data that will go into a commit.
The working area is the area within the repositiory
The repository contains the git metadata
The staging area allows you to specifiy specific commits rather than committing everything in the working area
