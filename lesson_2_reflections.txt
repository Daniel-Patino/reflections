>What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repositiory you are allowing git to add metadata that will be important for it to function properly

>How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area will hold specific data that will go into a commit.
The working area is the area within the repositiory
The repository contains the git metadata
The staging area allows you to specifiy specific commits rather than committing everything in the working area

>How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area shows you if modifications have been made between your commit and your change

>What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Any situation in which I might wish to make want to add an experimental feature or change something in a certain direction

>How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps in the sense that the branch structure is much like a tree diagram, it is easier to visisualize branching when you can see it.

>What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches is combining any additions made onto them, or deletions provided they both have the same stuff deleted.

>What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

The automatic merging saves a ton of time as long as there are no conflicts.
